Place the provided icon image named `icon.png` into this folder.

The repository currently contains the image at:
Heartbeat/icon.png

To ensure Xcode uses it for all app-icon slots, copy or move that file here (so the filename in this folder is `icon.png`).

Example (macOS terminal):

cp ../icon.png ./icon.png

After copying, clean build folder in Xcode and rebuild the app.
